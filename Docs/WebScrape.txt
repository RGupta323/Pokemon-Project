This file is to serve as documentation for the python file WebScrape.py.

At first, the file was to use urllib and beautiful soup to scrape the websites itself, which would depend on a input
dictionary or an object. But now this python file is going to be used to ideally automate parsehub which is an api that
allows us to scrape websites more easily.

The point of this file is to have a couple of basic functions that can be able to scrape needed data from any given url.

In order to use this project, first you must go to ParseHub and download it (https://www.parsehub.com/quickstart), then
you must start a project and then enter the url that you wish to scrape. It'll take you to this user interface (GUI) and
with that you can use a combination of selectors, relative selectors and commands, to scrape the data that you want.

Refer to this github repo (https://github.com/hronecviktor/py-parsehub), these provide simple functions to find a project
and get a project via python. But the directions above to use ParseHub must be done first.

Refer to these API docs (https://www.parsehub.com/docs/ref/api/v2/)
