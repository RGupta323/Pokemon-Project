So this is more of a day by day account of what I did, what errors, I encountered
how I solved them. If I'm changing direction of the project (which I did quite often).

So today, I added JSON.py which is a python file to read, write, print, and append
to a JSON file. I decided to work on this because while using ParseHub there were
just way too many issues with a CSV file, but with a JSON each entry per say can
contain multiple values, and can list the data much more effectively.

Although another issue I encountered is that data can be missing for some entries like
for example, Venasaur is missing some stats information. So I outlined several projects
that I wanted to do in ParseHub.txt so I'll initiate thouse but most likely they will be
using JSON files.

Ran into some problems with JUnit, don't think its running my
test function that I created. It only runs the first one, so
I called the second test function in the first one, and its not
doing anything. I don't know if its always returning true
because my function was called and it returned true.

Looked into the JUnit testing issues we encountered them and we
fixed it. So all functions within the junit class they must have
test_functionanme(self) this signature, so "test_" must be
declared. Otherwise this function (located
 in JSONTest.py) won't run them.

And yes my function works. Weirdly though it doesn't print
anything even when the print() function is called. Its just
blank. Now which tells me that the variable r is blank.
